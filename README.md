## About
---------------------------
##### This repository is a simple approavh on the APTOS 2019 Kaggle competitiaon using DenseNet121. I have learned a lot exploring several awesome kernels that people shared during the competition phase and have tried to cite the sources wherever I used or modified any codes from those kernels, however, I might have missed some sources despite my best effort, would highly appreciate feedback if any issue is found or suggestions/discussions about the project.
